        <h6>An Ideal Husband</h6> 
        <h3>Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House</h3>
        <p> LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
            armchair_.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the
             fireplace_. _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement 
             and distress_. _As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and 
             down the room_.
<h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?</p>

<h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>  <p>Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.</p>

<h6>LORD GORING.></h6>  <p>[_Taking off his left-hand glove_.]</p>  
<p>What a pity!  I beg your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite 
    mean that.  But if what youtell me is true, I should like to have
     a serious talk about life with Lady Chiltern.</p>
 
<h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>  <p>It would be quite useless.</p>

<h6>LORD GORING</h6> <P>May I try?</P> 

<h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>  <p>Yes; but nothing could make her alter her views.</p>

<h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <h6>Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological
    experiment.</h6>

<h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>  <p>All such experiments are terribly dangerous.</p>

<h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow.  If it wasn’t so,
    life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
    you should have told her years ago</p>

<h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>  <p>When?  When we were engaged?  Do you think she
    would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
    such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done
    a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?
    </p>

<h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>[_Slowly_.]</p>  <p>Yes; most men would call it ugly names.  There
    is no doubt of that.</p>

<h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>  <p>[_Bitterly_.]</p>  <p>Men who every day do something of
    the same kind themselves.  Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets
    in their own lives.</p>

<h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
    people’s secrets.  It distracts public attention from their own.</p>

<h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>  <p>And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did?  No
    one.</p>

<h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>[_Looking at him steadily_.]</p>  <p>Except yourself, Robert.</p>

<h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>  <p>[_After a pause_.]</p>  <p>Of course I had private
    information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of
    the day, and I acted on it.  Private information is practically the
    source of every large modern fortune.</p>

<h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>[_Tapping his boot with his cane_.] </p> <p>And public scandal
    invariably the result.</p>
