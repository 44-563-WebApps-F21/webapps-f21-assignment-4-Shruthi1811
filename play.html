    <h3>Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House</h3>
    <p> LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
        armchair_. SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the
        fireplace_. _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement
        and distress_. _As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and
        down the room_.</p>
    <h6 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?</p>

    <h6 class="name SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.</p>

    <h6 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="stage_directions">[_Taking off his left-hand glove_.]</p>
    <p class="speech">What a pity! I beg your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite
        mean that. But if what youtell me is true, I should like to have
        a serious talk about life with Lady Chiltern.</p>

    <h6 class="name SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech">It would be quite useless.</p>

    <h6 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <P class="speech">May I try?</P>

    <h6 class="name SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Yes; but nothing could make her alter her views.</p>

    <h6 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological
        experiment.</p>

    <h6 class="name SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech">All such experiments are terribly dangerous.</p>

    <h6 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow. If it wasn’t so,
        life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
        you should have told her years ago</p>

    <h6 class="name SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech">When? When we were engaged? Do you think she
        would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
        such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done
        a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?
    </p>

    <h6 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="stage_directions">[_Slowly_.]</p>
    <p class="speech">Yes; most men would call it ugly names. There
        is no doubt of that.</p>

    <h6 class="name SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="stage_directions">[_Bitterly_.]</p>
    <p class="speech">Men who every day do something of
        the same kind themselves. Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets
        in their own lives.</p>

    <h6 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="speech">That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
        people’s secrets. It distracts public attention from their own.</p>

    <h6 class="name SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech">And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did? No
        one.</p>

    <h6 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="stage_directions">[_Looking at him steadily_.]</p>
    <p class="speech">Except yourself, Robert.</p>

    <h6 class="name SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="stage_directions">[_After a pause_.]</p>
    <p class="speech">Of course I had private
        information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of
        the day, and I acted on it. Private information is practically the
        source of every large modern fortune.</p>

    <h6 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="stage_directions">[_Tapping his boot with his cane_.] </p>
    <p class="speech">And public scandal
        invariably the result.</p>
